### Detailed Explanation

# 1. **Opening the File**:
#    ```python
#    with open("practice2.txt", "r") as f:
#    ```
#    - This line opens the file `practice2.txt` in read mode (`"r"`). The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after the block of code is executed, even if an error occurs.

# 2. **Reading the File**:
#    ```python
#    data = f.read()
#    ```
#    - This line reads the entire content of the file into the variable `data` as a single string. For example, if the file contains `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10`, the `data` variable will contain this exact string.

# 3. **Printing the Data**:
#    ```python
#    print(data)
#    ```
#    - This line prints the content of the `data` variable to the console. For our example, it will print:
#      ```
#      1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
#      ```

# 4. **Splitting the Data into Numbers**:
#    ```python
#    nums = data.split(',')
#    ```
#    - The `split` function breaks the string `data` into a list of substrings based on the delimiter provided, which is a comma (`,`). For our example, `data.split(',')` will produce the list:
#      ```python
#      nums = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10']
#      ```
#    - **How `split` Works**:
#      - The `split` function takes a delimiter (in this case, `,`) and divides the string wherever this delimiter occurs. Each segment between the delimiters becomes an element in the resulting list.

# 5. **Initializing the Even Count**:
#    ```python
#    even_count = 0
#    ```
#    - This line initializes a counter `even_count` to zero. This counter will be used to count the even numbers.

# 6. **Iterating Over the Numbers**:
#    ```python
#    for num in nums:
#    ```
#    - This line starts a `for` loop that iterates over each element in the `nums` list. Each element is assigned to the variable `num` in each iteration.

# 7. **Stripping Whitespace and Converting to Integer**:
#    ```python
#    num = int(num.strip())
#    ```
#    - `num.strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the string `num`. However, since there is no extra whitespace in our example, it essentially leaves the strings unchanged.
#    - **How `strip` Works**:
#      - The `strip` function removes any leading (at the beginning) and trailing (at the end) whitespace from a string. If no argument is provided, it removes spaces. If a specific character is provided, it removes that character.
#      - For instance, `' 2 '.strip()` would return `'2'`.
#    - `int(num.strip())` then converts the stripped string to an integer. For example, if `num` is `'2'`, `num.strip()` is still `'2'`, and `int('2')` converts it to the integer `2`.

# 8. **Checking for Even Numbers**:
#    ```python
#    if num % 2 == 0:
#    ```
#    - This line checks if the integer `num` is even. The `%` operator computes the remainder of `num` divided by `2`. If the remainder is `0`, the number is even.

# 9. **Incrementing the Even Count and Printing the Even Number**:
#    ```python
#    even_count += 1
#    print(num)
#    ```
#    - If the number is even, `even_count` is incremented by `1`.
#    - The even number is printed to the console. For example, for `num = 2`, `4`, `6`, `8`, `10`, these numbers will be printed individually.

# 10. **Printing the Count of Even Numbers**:
#     ```python
#     print("Count of even numbers:", even_count)
#     ```
#     - After the loop completes, the total count of even numbers is printed to the console.

# ### Example with File Content

# Assume `practice2.txt` contains:
# ```
# 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
# ```

# ### Output of the Code
# ```
# 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
# 10
# Count of even numbers: 5
# ```

# This output shows that the code successfully reads the file, splits the numbers, counts the even ones, and prints both the even numbers and their total count.
