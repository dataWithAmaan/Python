When naming a Python file, avoid these common pitfalls:

1. Don’t use Python keywords**: Avoid names like `class.py`, `import.py`, or `list.py`, as these are reserved words in Python and can cause conflicts.
2. Don’t use names of standard libraries**: Avoid names that match built-in Python modules, such as `math.py`, `random.py`, or `os.py`. This can lead to unexpected behavior when you try to import these modules.
3. Avoid spaces**: Spaces in file names can cause issues in the command line and with imports. Use underscores instead.
4. Don’t start with a number**: File names should not begin with a digit, as this can cause syntax errors.
5. Avoid special characters**: Stick to letters, numbers, and underscores. Symbols like `@`, `#`, `$`, or `-` can cause issues.
6. Keep it case-consistent**: Avoid mixing uppercase and lowercase letters (e.g., `MyScript.py`). Lowercase is the preferred style for Python file names.

# Example of a good name
- ✅ `data_processing.py`

# Examples to avoid
- ❌ `class.py`
- ❌ `data-processing.py`
- ❌ `1data.py`
- ❌ `math.py`
